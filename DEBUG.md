**Your Code might not be running due to the following (the guide is for Kali Linux mainly)
**1. Firewall Check:**

* **Kali Firewall:** Kali uses UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). Check if it's active with `sudo ufw status` and temporarily disable it with `sudo ufw disable` to see if port scans show different results.
* **VM Firewall:** Depending on your virtualization software, there might be an additional firewall on the VM itself. Consult the documentation for instructions on checking and disabling it.

**2. Network Configuration:**

* **IP Address:** Verify you're using the correct IP address of the VM for scanning. If using NAT, you need the VM's internal IP, not the host system's.
* **Network Mode:** Check your VM's network adapter mode setting. Bridged mode is recommended for most cases if you require external interaction.

**3. Service Verification:**

* **Running Services:** Ensure the services you expect to have open ports are actually running on the VM. Use `sudo systemctl status [service_name]` to check their status.
* **Port Assignments:** Some services might not listen on the default ports. Check their configuration files or documentation for the specific ports they use.

**4. nmap Scan Techniques:**

* **Basic Scan:** Try a basic `nmap [target_ip]` scan and see if it detects any open ports.
* **Port Range Scan:** If you expect specific ports to be open, use `nmap -p [port_range] [target_ip]` to target those ports directly.
* **TCP vs. UDP Scans:** Depending on the service, you might need a TCP scan (`-sT`) or UDP scan (`-sU`).
* **Verbose Output:** Add `-v` or `-vv` to nmap commands for more detailed information about the scan process and results.

**5. Additional Tools:**

* **netstat:** Run `netstat -nlp` on the VM itself to see which ports are actively listening.
* **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE):** Use nmap scripts specific to the services you're looking for (e.g., http-scan, ssh-brute) for more advanced probing.

Remember, if you're still struggling after trying these steps, feel free to share the exact nmap commands you're using and any specific messages or errors you're encountering. The more details you provide, the better I can assist you in pinpointing the cause of the inconclusive results.

I hope this helps you successfully identify open ports on your Kali Linux VM!
